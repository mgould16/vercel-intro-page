                    <p>
                        I have over a decade of experience in Customer Success, specializing in Enterprise SaaS, APIs, and
                        technical integrations. I've managed multi-million-dollar portfolios across EMEA and APAC, helping
                        customers integrate DAM, CMS, and PIM systems while optimizing workflows with automation. I'm passionate
                        about problem-solving and value-driven adoption, and looking forward to my next challenge in a similar
                        space.

                    <h2 class="section-title">Why I'm Excited About Vercel</h2>
                    <p>Vercel plays in a similar space to where I am today - front-end best practices and integrations with other systems. Many of my customers now choose to deploy on Vercel (or a competitor) to create a highly performant web experience for their users as part of their composable commerce strategy. I've also watched the growth of Vercel from afar - now having 3 former colleagues join you, seeing the rise in popularity of Next.js, and seeing at least 2 Vercel billboards in San Francisco.</p>

                    <p>I am at the start of my journey learning the Korean language! After ~4 lessons I know more vocabulary and how to say "Hello, my name is Mark. I am English, I am an office worker".</p>
