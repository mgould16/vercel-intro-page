                <p>Vercel operates similarly to my current role, focusing on front-end best practices and seamless integrations with other platforms. Many of my customers now choose to deploy on Vercel (or similar solutions) to build high-performance web experiences as part of their composable commerce strategy. I've also closely followed Vercel’s growth—seeing three former colleagues join the team, the increasing popularity of Next.js, and even spotting multiple Vercel billboards in San Francisco.</p>
